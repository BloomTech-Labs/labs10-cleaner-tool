## Introducing Lodgel â€“ the property management application that streamlines the rental process.

Users register for an account, and right away, they can start adding properties to their list.
To ensure each guest is taken care of, checklists can be made that detail tasks that need to be taken care of
before, during, and after each visit. 

Assistants are an essential element of every property management business. Each property has an assistant 
assigned to take care of it by default, but they can be moved around if necessary. Each assistant 
has a map attached to their profile, which conveniently shows their location relative to the property they
maintain. They can also select other properties that they are able to help take care of, saving you time 
and effort in finding someone to cover another assistant in the event they are unavailable.

You can also keep tabs on your guest throughout their entire rental experience. After putting in a reservation,
you can keep your assistants up to date with your guests needs by adding items to their checklists. Since your 
guests' needs may change over the course of their stay, these additions can be directed to be done before, during,
and even after their stay to ensure they have the best possible experience. 

When your guest is ready to check out, you can generate an invoice for them, and can also process their payment through
Stripe. Simply select a subscription plan based on the number of properties you manage, sign up for a Stripe account, and 
you are ready to go!
